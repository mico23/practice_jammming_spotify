# Jamming - Spotify Web App

This is a React web app I created when I took the online course of JavaScript from Codecademy. It allows users to search the Spotify library, create playlist, and save it to the usersâ€™ Spotify account.

## Getting Started

The following are the steps to run this project on your local computer.

### Prerequisites

Node.js must be installed to run this project. You may down Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).

After Node.js is installed, you may get a access token from [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and replace 'clieantId' in the Spotify module under util folder. The [Spotify Authentication guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/) will be helpful to update the method.

```
const clientId = 'your token';
```

## Running the tests

Execute the following to run the project on your local computer.

```
npm run build

npm run start
```
